## Eric and Kai's Visual Cookbook

**Project Description**: Eric and Kai's Visual Cookbook is a combination of three APIs (recipe, photo, and video) with the intention of giving users the ability to recreate food recipes in a fun and visual way.

The three APIs used are the following:
1. Pixabay API
- Used to fetch photos for the recipe ingredients
2. Spoonacular API
- The main API used to fetch recipe information like ingredients, summary and steps
3. YouTube API
- API used to add a video resource for users to watch in making the recipes

**Three Interactions**
1. Dropdown menu
- Used to select the recipe
2. Radio Button
- Used to select the specific background color
3. Checkbox
- Used to toggle the video resource located at the bottom of the page

**Where is the table?**
- The table is used to display the recipe's nutrional data such as calories and carbohydrates
