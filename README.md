## Eric and Kai's Visual Cookbook

**Members**: Eric Rosario and Kai Huang

**Project Description**: Eric and Kai's Visual Cookbook is a combination of three APIs (recipe, photo, and video) with the intention of giving users the ability to recreate food recipes in a fun and visual way.

The three APIs used are the following:
1. Pixabay API
- Used to fetch photos for the recipe ingredients
2. Spoonacular API
- The main API used to fetch recipe information like ingredients, summary and steps
3. YouTube API
- API used to add a video resource for users to watch in making the recipes
